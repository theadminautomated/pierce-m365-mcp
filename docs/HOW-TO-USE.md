# How To Use The Pierce County MCP Server

This guide is written for very young users. It's super simple!

1. **Ask the server.**
   - Type a request like "Please make a new mailbox for toys" or "Give mom access to the family calendar." The MCP server understands regular sentences.
2. **Wait a moment.**
   - The server thinks about your request and does all the hard work by itself.
3. **See the result.**
   - The server writes down everything it did in the log file and tells you if it worked.
4. **All done!**
   - If something goes wrong, the server fixes it automatically or lets an adult know.

That's it! The MCP server handles everything for you.
